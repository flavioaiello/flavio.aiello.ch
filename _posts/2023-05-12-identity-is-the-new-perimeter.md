Having read about numerous zero-trust concepts and their origins in the 2000s some time ago, and working on the topic for a few years, I recently wondered what the key takeaways and lessons are. Given the importance of the topic, I invite discussion and sharing of interpretations.

## Introduction
In response to significant cyberattacks, in the late 2000s known as Operation Aurora, cybersecurity underwent a significant transformation with the Zero Trust Security model. Aurora made it clear that perimeters were no longer an effective measure with increasing mobility and cloud computing. A new approach was quickly found in the Jericho Forum represented principles of deperimeterization. 

The paradigm shift is due in part to the realization that traditional network perimeters can no longer effectively contain the risks posed by increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats. Although its roots in network security, it is important to understand that its application extends far beyond the network.

Zero Trust is a comprehensive approach to security that goes beyond network security to include application security, identity management, and data security. The Zero Trust model views every access request as a potential threat, regardless of where it comes from or what resources it requests. It encompasses an organization's entire infrastructure and emphasizes the need for security at all levels - from the users accessing the system, to the workloads processing data, to all connected devices, and finally to the data itself.

By adopting, organizations improve their overall cybersecurity posture by creating a more robust and resilient defense against a variety of potential threats. The goal, however, is not to make organizations impenetrable - an impossible task given today's complexity and interconnectedness - but to reduce the attack surface and limit the potential damage from breaches when they do occur.

## The Identities Triade
One of the foundational aspects of the Zero Trust model is the principle of identity. Under the Zero Trust model, trust is seen as a vulnerability. However, instead of assuming that everything is fine within an organization, individuals, software, and devices must be continuously verified:

- **Person Identity:** Every user, whether an employee, vendor, or customer, has a unique identity. This identity must be authenticated before access is granted. In a Zero Trust model, this identity verification isn't a one-time process. Instead, users' identities are continuously checked and validated to ensure they remain trustworthy.
- **Workload Identity:** Every instantiated software artifact, whether traditionally provisioned, application containers or functions is a workload. Each of these workloads has its own identity that needs to be authenticated, particularly when communicating with other workloads. The SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone) standard is often used to manage workload identity, facilitating the secure workload-to-workload communication.
- **Device Identity:** Every device that connects to the network, be it a mobile device, a work device, or a compute device, also has an identity. These devices must be authenticated and their security posture continuously validated. This is to ensure that every device on the network is secure and cannot be used as a potential entry point for threats. Intriguingly, the device's kernel is regarded as an integral component, ideally abstracted since OCI.

By recognizing and verifying these three identities, organizations can ensure a more secure environment. This trifold approach to identity ensures that every person, workload, and device is verified before access is granted, and that their activities are continuously authorized and monitored. It is an essential part of the Zero Trust model and a cornerstone of effective cybersecurity.

## Zero Trust Tenets
It's essential to acknowledge that all Zero Trust Concepts align with the seven core tenets of Zero Trust as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). These principles serve as the guiding framework for Zero Trustimplementation and include:

1. Networks should always be considered hostile.
2. External and internal threats exist on all networks.
3. Network locality is not sufficient for deciding trust in a network.
4. Every device, user, and network flow is authenticated and authorized.
5. Policies must be dynamic and calculated from as many sources of data as possible.
6. All resources are accessed securely regardless of their location.
7. Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis.

This provides a robust foundation upon which the Zero Trust model stands, with concepts from CISA, DOD, Microsoft, and Forrester, among others, all adhering to these tenets in their approaches to Zero Trust.

## The Convergence to Five Pillars
All Zero Trust concepts converge around five fundamental pillars that encapsulate the comprehensive nature of this security model. Each pillar serves a distinct purpose within the Zero Trust architecture but together, they form a cohesive and interdependent structure.

1. **Identity:** The Zero Trust model hinges on the principle that every user must be authenticated and their access continuously authorized, thereby ensuring that they are who they claim to be.
2. **Device:** Whether it's a mobile device, a work device, or a compute device, every device connecting to a network could potentially introduce risk. These devices must be authenticated and their security posture continuously validated.
3. **Network:** The Zero Trust model assumes that every network is potentially hostile. As such, all network traffic is treated as untrusted and must be verified before it's permitted.
4. **Workload:** Every application or workload, regardless of its environment, has its own identity and needs to be authenticated, especially for workload-to-workload communication. This is often managed through standards like SPIFFE.
5. **Data:** As the ultimate target for most cyber threats, data is a critical pillar in the Zero Trust model. Ensuring secure access to data, and data leakage prevention, regardless of its location, is a key element of Zero Trust, with the principle of least privilege access being central to this approach.

By placing these five pillars at the core, organizations can build a robust Zero Trust architecture that aligns with the core tenets outlined by NIST, and effectively manage and mitigate the potential security risks in our increasingly interconnected digital world.

## Traffic Flow
A key aspect to consider within the Network Pillar in the Zero Trust Model is traffic flow, often delineated into two categories:

- **North-South Flow:** This term refers to a person accessing a workload, this would be considered north-south flow. Products branded as Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) or Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) are purposely built to control and safeguard this particular traffic pattern.
- **East-West Flow:** This term is used to describe the workload-to-workload communication flow. Service Meshes are intentionally designed to control and provide security for this kind of traffic.

With a clear understanding of both north-south and east-west flows, organizations can more effectively apply the Zero Trust model. All traffic, whether its direction, is authenticated, authorized, and continuously verified under this model. This comprehensive approach to traffic validation and control contributes to a more secure environment, reducing potential attack vectors and enhancing overall security posture.

## The Secure Software Supply Chain
Within the Workload Pillar of the Zero Trust model, the secure software supply chain emerges as a critical capability. The provisioning of software occurs uniformly declarative, regardless of whether the software artifacts originate in-house or are supplied. Given our continuous effort to reconcile workloads desired state with the actual state through not just the Kubernetes API, but also the Hyperscaler API, it's evident that declarative production models will prevail.  

Interestingly, initiatives like Crossplane were purposefully designed to reconcile the Hyperscaler API through the Kubernetes API. However, these often manifest as management clusters, tying up operational resources and inadvertently introducing a levered risk, rather than adhering to a more streamlined cattle design. This serves as yet another testament to the persistent relevance of Conway's Law.

Key factors that ensure security in the software supply chain include Extended Application Security Testing (xAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), signed code, signed artifacts, and workload manifests. xAST offers a comprehensive methodology for application security testing aimed at identifying potential vulnerabilities. SCA facilitates the scrutiny of open-source components and third-party APIs for vulnerabilities and licensing issues. The authenticity and integrity of the software are verified through signed code and signed artifacts, which also prevent unauthorized changes. Furthermore, workload and cloud resource manifests, which outline the expected operations of a workload, can be signed and verified for extra security, ensuring that the workload performs in the intended environment. Collectively, these strategies diminish security risks in the software supply chain.

## Conclusion
As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Zero Trust model provides a proactive and comprehensive security strategy for organizations. Through this paradigm shift, organizations can stay one step ahead of potential threats and ensure they remain secure, compliant and resilient in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.

Zero Trust is more than just a security model; it's a business enabler. By adopting a Zero Trust approach, organizations can increase agility, foster innovation, and deliver a better customer experience - all while keeping their data secure. Therefore, Zero Trust should be considered an essential part of any digital transformation.
