# A Vision for the Future: Rethinking System Architecture and Security

The advent of an increasingly sophisticated digital landscape has precipitated a need to revisit and reassess our understanding of system architecture and security. The traditional paradigms that have served us well over the past two decades, deeply rooted in the Borg system, are now under scrutiny. The question of the hour is: Are these paradigms capable of catering to the demands of an evolving digital landscape? To explore this question, we invite you to join us on a thought-provoking journey with a vision and a [playground](https://www.beemesh.io) to experiment.

This year in 2020, while designing a large-scale, federated service mesh based on zero-trust adoption, a new vision was formed. This vision, akin to “Eywa” from the movie Avatar, envisioned a globally interconnected system that could revolutionize how we understand system boundaries. While a comprehensive proof of this vision is yet to be created, we are eager to share our initial thoughts and have provided a platform for experimentation at [beemesh.io](https://www.beemesh.io).

We envision a seismic shift in the current perimeter paradigm, where the rigid legacy systems are replaced by a dynamic, adaptive model. This model, inspired by the likes of Bittorrent and its millions of nodes in the Web3, would be built on loosely coupled nodes using the publish-subscribe model, resulting in a system providing resilience, security, and unlimited scalability to handle fluctuating workloads.

This model could cater to the growing norm of stateless workloads, rendering the need for rigid, inflexible clustering obsolete. Instead, consistency would no longer be a one-size-fits-all attribute, but rather something that could be custom-tailored to each workload's specific requirements. 

Workload sidecars could play a pivotal role in managing different types of consistency for different workloads. For stateless workloads, they can ensure eventual consistency, facilitating a more distributed and resilient approach to handling data. For stateful workloads, on the other hand, they can enforce strong consistency, thus maintaining data integrity and reliability. With this sidecar-based model, scalability would no longer be restricted, and integrity and performance can be preserved while catering to diverse workloads.

Security, a paramount concern in this digital era, can be enhanced by incorporating workload identity into userland sockets — a niche technique now known as slirp4netns. This methodology strictly adheres to zero-trust principles and provides a level of security and traceability that traditional approaches fall short of providing.

Our vision also calls for a decentralization of traditional roles. The scheduler, traditionally a centralised entity, would evolve into a decentralised, topic-based algorithm. Similarly, APIs would undergo modifications to ensure that legacy workload manifests can be reused, guaranteeing compatibility with existing ecosystems and facilitating a seamless transition from the current architecture to “Eywa”.

Central to this vision is the incorporation of AI, which could manage the complexity of distributed orchestration, adjust consistency requirements, mitigate transition disruptions, and even improve security measures. AI could be key to distributing workloads globally and adapting to changes based on factors such as solar power production and geographic variations. In this scenario, the connected world is not just reactive, but predictive, adapting to changes even before they occur.

This vision may seem radical today, but it is such bold ideas that ignite innovation and reshape the world. Innovation happens when we challenge established norms. With this in mind, we invite you to join us at [beemesh.io](https://www.beemesh.io) to explore this vision further and join the discussion on the future of system architecture and security.
